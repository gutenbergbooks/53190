      <div class='line'>Yes, I love you, dear Matilda,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But you may not be my bride,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the obstacles are many</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Which have caused me to decide.</div>
      <div class='line'>Firstly, what is <i>most</i> annoying,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And I'm not above confessing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is, that I think you indolent,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And over-fond of dressing.</div>
      <div class='line'>I've known you spend an hour or two</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In a-sitting on a chair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a-fussing and attending</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_21'></a>There's another little matter—</div>

      <div class='line'>Yet, Matilda, I must own it,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I object to hear you sing.</div>
      <div class='line'>For the sounds you make in singing</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Are so <i>very</i> much like squalling,</div>
      <div class='line'>That the only term appropriate</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To them is caterwauling.</div>
      <div class='line'>Indeed, I've never <i>heard</i> such horrid</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Noises in my life,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I'd <i>certainly</i> not tolerate</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such singing in a wife.</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And, Matilda dear, your language!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It is really <i>very</i> bad;</div>
      <div class='line'>The expressions which you use at times,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They make me feel quite sad.</div>
      <div class='line'>It is very, very shocking,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But I do not mind declaring</div>
      <div class='line'>That I've heard some sounds proceeding</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From your lips so much like swearing,</div>
      <div class='line'>That I've had to raise a finger,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And to close at least <i>one</i> ear,</div>
      <div class='line'>For I couldn't feel quite certain</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lord William of Purleigh retired for the night</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With a mind full of worry and trouble,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>If, of "moneys received," one spends double.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His lordship had gone rather early to bed,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And for several hours had been sleeping,</div>
      <div class='line'>When he suddenly woke—and the hair on his head</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Slowly rose—he could hear someone creeping</div>
      <div class='line'>About in his room, in the dead of the night,</div>
      <div class='line'>With a lantern, which showed but a glimmer of light,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And his impulse, at first, was to cover his head</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When he heard that there burglar a-creeping.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_56'></a>But presently thinking "Poor fellow, there's naught</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In the house worth a burglar a-taking,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, being a kind-hearted lord, p'r'aps I ought,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To explain the mistake he's a-making."</div>
      <div class='line'>Lord William, then still in his woolly night-cap</div>
      <div class='line'>(For appearances noblemen don't care a rap),</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His second-best dressing-gown hastily sought,</div>

      <div class='line'>And bowed, as his lordship, continuing, said:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>"Excuse me a moment. I'll find if I can</div>

      <div class='line'>Then the household his lordship aroused, if you please,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And invited the burglar to supper.</div>
      <div class='line'>The burglar told tales of his hardly-won wealth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And each drank to the other one's jolly good health.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There's a charm about informal parties like these,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And it was a most excellent supper.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line in2'>They are hopes which, perhaps, I might talk of to some,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But which to a lord—no, I dare not express."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_58'></a>"Pooh! Nonsense!" his lordship cried, "Out with it, man!</div>

      <div class='line'>Rely upon me. I will do what I can.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Come! Let us see what's to be done for the best."</div>
      <div class='line'>"I've a daughter," the burglar remarked with a sigh.</div>
      <div class='line'>"The apple is she, so to speak, of my eye,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And she wishes to marry a lord, if she can—</div>

      <div class='line'>Lord William, at first, was inclined to look glum,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>In the morning, to-morrow, the lady to see</div>

      <div class='line'>Take warning, good friends, and beware of the fate</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of this asinine practical joker,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who early in life caused the keenest distress</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Tho' I may not, of course, be exact on</div>

  <h2 class='c004'>XVI.<br />THAT OF THE AUCTIONEER'S DREAM.</h2>
</div>
<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I'll proceed to the narration</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of a trifling episode</div>
      <div class='line'>In the life of Mr. Platt,</div>
      <div class='line in14'>An auctioneer,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who was filled with jubilation</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And remarked: "Well, I'll be blowed!"—</div>
      <div class='line'>An expression rather im-</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Polite, I fear.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But he dreamt he'd heard it stated</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That, in future, auctioneers</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Might include their near relations</i></div>
      <div class='line in14'><i>In their sales</i>;</div>
      <div class='line'>And he felt so much elated</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That he broke out into cheers,</div>
      <div class='line'>As one's apt to do when other</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Language fails.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_81'></a>And he thought: "Dear me, I'd better</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Seize this opportunity</div>
      <div class='line'>Of getting rid of ma-in-law,</div>
      <div class='line in14'>And Jane—</div>
      <div class='line'>(<i>'Twas his wife</i>)—I'll not regret her;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And, indeed, it seems to me</div>
      <div class='line'>Such a chance may really not</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Occur again.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"And, indeed, while I'm about it,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I'll dispense with all the lot—</div>
      <div class='line'>(O'er my family I've lately</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Lost command)—</div>
      <div class='line'>'Tis the best plan, never doubt it.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I'll dispose of those I've got,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, perhaps, I'll get some others</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Second-hand."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So his ma-in-law he offered</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As the first lot in the sale,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he knocked <i>her</i> down for two-</div>
      <div class='line in14'>And-six, or less.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then Mrs. Platt he proffered—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She was looking rather pale;</div>
      <div class='line'>But she fetched a good round sum,</div>
      <div class='line in14'>I must confess.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_82'></a>Sister Ann was slightly damaged,</div>

      <div class='line'>But I can't think <i>how</i> he managed</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His wife's grandmother to sell—</div>

      <div class='line in2'>(I <i>would</i> tell you, but I can't</div>

      <div class='line'>And the servants made him snappy;</div>

      <div class='line in14'>Ill at ease.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So he calmly thought it over.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>"On the whole, perhaps," said he,</div>
      <div class='line'>I had better buy my fam-</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But the persons who had bought 'em</div>

      <div class='line'>For quite priceless now he thought 'em,</div>

      <div class='line'>Miss Miriam Briggs was a plain, plain cook,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And her cooking was none too good</div>
      <div class='line'>(Not at all like the recipes out of the book,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, in fact, one might tell at the very first look</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That things hadn't been made as they should).</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_87'></a>Her master, a person named Lymmington-Blake,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>At her cooking did constantly grieve,</div>
      <div class='line'>And at last he declared that "a change he must make,"</div>
      <div class='line'>For he "wanted a cook who could boil or could bake,"</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And—this very plain cook—"she must leave."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So she left, and her master, the very same day,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For the Registry Office set out,</div>
      <div class='line'>For he naturally thought it the very best way</div>
      <div class='line'>Of procuring a cook with the smallest delay.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>(You, too, would have done so, no doubt.)</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But, "A cook? Goodness gracious!" the lady declared</div>
      <div class='line in2'>(At the Registry Office, I mean),</div>
      <div class='line'>"I've no cook on my books, sir, save one, and she's shared</div>
      <div class='line'>By two families; and, sir, I've nearly despaired,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For so rare, sir, of late, cooks have been."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Where next he enquired 'twas precisely the same:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There wasn't a cook to be had.</div>
      <div class='line'>Though quite high were the wages he'd willingly name,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he advertised,—uselessly,—none ever came,—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Not a cook, good, indiff'rent, or bad.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_88'></a>What <i>was</i> to be done? Mr. Lymmington-Blake</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Began to grow thinner and thinner.</div>
      <div class='line'>(Now and then it is pleasant, but <i>quite</i> a mistake,</div>
      <div class='line'>To dine every day on a chop or a steak,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And have nothing besides for your dinner.)</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So he said: "If I can't get a cook, then a mate</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I'll endeavour to find in a wife"</div>
      <div class='line'>(His late wife deceased, I p'r'aps ought to relate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Four or five years before), "for this terrible state</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of things worries me out of my life."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So he looked in the papers, and read with delight</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of a "Lady of good education,</div>
      <div class='line'>A charming complexion, eyes blue (rather light),"</div>
      <div class='line'>Who "would to a gentleman willingly write."</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She "preferred one without a relation."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Now Lymmington-Blake was an orphan from birth,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And had neither a sister nor brother,</div>
      <div class='line'>While of uncles and aunts he'd a similar dearth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he thought, "Here's a lady of singular worth;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I should think we should suit one another."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_89'></a>So he wrote to the lady, and she wrote to him,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the lady requested a photo,</div>
      <div class='line'>But he thought, "I'm not young, and the picture might dim</div>
      <div class='line'>Her affection; I'll plead, to the lady, a whim,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And refuse her my photo <i>in toto</i>."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"I'll be happy, however," he wrote, "to arrange</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A meeting for Wednesday night.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hampstead Heath, on the pathway, beside the old Grange,</div>
      <div class='line'>At a quarter to eight. If you won't think it strange,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Wear a rose—I shall know you at sight."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Came Wednesday night, Mr. Lymmington-Blake</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To the <i>rendezvous</i> all in a flutter</div>
      <div class='line'>Himself—in a new suit of clothes—did betake;</div>
      <div class='line'>And over and over, to save a mistake,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The speech he had thought of did mutter.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>He</i> wore a red rose, for he thought it would show</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He had taken the matter to heart.</div>
      <div class='line'>A lady was there. Was it she? Yes, or no?</div>
      <div class='line'>Blake didn't know whether to stay or to go.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He was nervous. But what made him start?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_90'></a>'Twas the figure—at first he could not see her face—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Which somehow familiar did look.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then she turned—and he ran. Do you think it was base?</div>
      <div class='line'>I fancy that you'd have done so in his place.</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>'Twas on the "Royal Sovereign,"</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Which sails from Old Swan Pier,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Henry Phipps met Emily Green,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And—<i>this</i> is somewhat queer—</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Aboard the ship was Obadiah,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Likewise a lady called Maria</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The surnames of these people I</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Cannot just now recall,</div>
      <div class='line'>But 'tis quite immaterial,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It matters not at all.</div>
      <div class='line'>The point is <i>this</i>—Phipps met Miss Green;</div>
      <div class='line'>The sequel quickly will be seen.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He noticed her the first time when</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To luncheon they went down</div>
      <div class='line'>(The luncheon on the "Sovereign"</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Is only half a-crown),</div>
      <div class='line'>Where Obadiah gravely at</div>
      <div class='line'>The table, with Maria, sat.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_92'></a>And Obadiah coughed because</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Phipps looked at Emily—she at him.</div>
      <div class='line'>Maria likewise noticed it,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And thereupon grew stern and grim,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though neither one of all the four</div>
      <div class='line'>Had met the other one before.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Now Emily Green was pretty, but</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Maria—she was the reverse;</div>
      <div class='line'>While Obadiah's looks were tra-</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Gic—something like Macbeth's, but worse.—</div>
      <div class='line'>And these two somehow seemed to be</div>
      <div class='line'>Quite down on Phipps, and Miss E. G.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For when <i>she</i> smiled, and kindly passed</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The salt—which Phipps had asked her for—</div>
      <div class='line'>Maria tossed her head and sniffed,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And Obadiah muttered "Pshaw!"</div>
      <div class='line'>While later on Miss E. G. thinks</div>
      <div class='line'>She heard Maria call her "minx."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_93'></a>Twice on the upper deck when Phipps</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Or comment on the "perfect" day,</div>
      <div class='line'>He caught Maria listening, and,</div>
      <div class='line'>Close by, saw Obadiah stand.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>At last, at Margate by the Sea,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The "Royal Sovereign" came to port.</div>
      <div class='line'>Phipps hurried off and soon secured</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A lodging very near The Fort</div>
      <div class='line'>(He'd understood Miss Green to say</div>
      <div class='line'>That she should lodge somewhere that way).</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He really <i>was</i> annoyed to find</div>

      <div class='line'>While Miss Maria, opposite,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The parlour blinds was peering through.</div>
      <div class='line'>Still he felt very happy, for</div>
      <div class='line'>He saw Miss Green arrive next door.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>That night he met her on the pier,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And Phipps, of course, he raised his hat.</div>
      <div class='line'>Miss Emily Green blushed, smiled, and stopped—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It was not to be wondered at.</div>
      <div class='line'>But Obadiah, passing by,</div>
      <div class='line'>Transfixed them with his eagle eye.</div>

      <div class='line'>And, later in the evening, when</div>

      <div class='line'>Phipps—tho' perhaps he oughtn't to—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Was gently squeezing Emily's hand.</div>
      <div class='line'>He dropped it suddenly, for there</div>
      <div class='line'>Maria stood, with stony stare.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'><a id='Page_95'></a>Could possibly account for this</div>
      <div class='line'>Sad interference with their bliss.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>At last Phipps, goaded to despair,</div>

      <div class='line'>But Obadiah turned away,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Merely ejaculating "Pish!"</div>
      <div class='line'>Then Phipps addressed Maria too,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all he got from <i>her</i> was "Pooh!"</div>

    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>To-day a bachelor and "widder."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The bachelor,—named Robinson,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>(A clerk, or something, in the City,</div>
      <div class='line'>Just what, we will not dwell upon),</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A pleasant man, and somewhat witty,</div>
      <div class='line'>But thin,—I've seldom known a thinner,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Dwelt in the suburbs, out at Pinner.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The widow lived at Pinner too,</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>Her</i> name Ann Partington, <i>née</i> Gair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And rich,—if what was said is true,—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Her age was forty; she was fair</div>
      <div class='line'>And fat—indeed, as for that matter,</div>
      <div class='line'>I've seldom known a person fatter.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_165'></a>Now Robinson considered: "Why</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Should I, an eligible man,</div>
      <div class='line'>In lonely 'diggings' live and die,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When I might marry widow Ann?</div>
      <div class='line'>I'll call, and tentatively mention</div>

      <div class='line'>The widow seemed at first inclined</div>

      <div class='line'>She said: "Yes, thank you, I don't mind,"</div>
      <div class='line in2'>(No shyness <i>there</i>, you understand),</div>
      <div class='line'>But later on said: "No, for us</div>
      <div class='line'>To marry would be ludicrous.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_166'></a>We'd be the laughing-stock, I fear,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of neighbours round about,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>And I am awfully stout;</div>
      <div class='line'>I must withhold consideration</div>
      <div class='line'>Till there's some drastic alteration."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So Robinson determined that</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He'd put on flesh somehow;</div>
      <div class='line'>He'd try all means of getting fat,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And made this solemn vow:</div>
      <div class='line'>"The widow,—well, he'd do without her</div>
      <div class='line'>Till he had grown a trifle stouter."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Laugh and grow fat," somebody said;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So, daily, Robinson</div>
      <div class='line'>The comic papers duly read,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And gloated thereupon:</div>
      <div class='line'>He spent no end of pocket money</div>

      <div class='line in2'>While (this was scarcely wise)</div>
      <div class='line'>He seldom moved from off his seat,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And took <i>no</i> exercise.</div>
      <div class='line'>'Twas not surprising, then—now, was it?—</div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
